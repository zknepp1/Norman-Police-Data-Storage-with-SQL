# DATABASE DEVELOPMENT
DATABASE BUILT USING SQLITE3 POACKAGE FOR PYTHON.

# BUGS AND ASSUMPTIONS
ASSUMPTIONS MADE
1. ALL OF DAILY INCIDENT SUMMARIES ARE ASSUMED TO BE STRUCTURED THE SAME.
2. THE USER WILL ENTER A CORRECT URL.
3. THE PROGRAM WILL EXECUTE IN UNDER 60 SECONDS, IF NOT THE DB CONNECTION WILL TIMEOUT.

POTENTIAL BUGS
1. PROGRAM WILL CRASH IF A INCORRECT URL IS ENTERED.
2. MY REGULAR EXPRESSIONS MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERY SINGLE INCIDENT AND ADDRESS. I DID MY BEST TO OPTIMIZE THE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS FOR ANY INPUT; HOWEVER IF MY REGULAR EXPRESSION DOES NOT FIND THE DATA, NULL IS ASSUMED.

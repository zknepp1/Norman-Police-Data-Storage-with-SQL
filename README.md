STORE_DATA_FROM_PDF(PDF, CON) - THIS FUNCTION TAKES THE LIST OF LINES FROM GET_PDF(URL) AND DATABASE CONNECTION AS PARAMETERS, USES REGULAR EXPRESSION TO EXTRACT THE TEXT DATA FROM THE LINES, AND INSERTS THE DATA INTO THE DATABASE USING THE ADD_TO_TABLE(DATETIME, INCIDENT_NUM, LOCATION, NATURE, ORI, CON) FUNCTION.

ADD_TO_TABLE(DATETIME, INCIDENT_NUM, LOCATION, NATURE, ORI, CON) - TAKES DATETIME, INCIDENT_NUM, LOCATION, NATURE, ORI, AND DATABASE CONNECTION AS PARAMETERS. STORES DATETIME, INCIDENT_NUM, LOCATION, NATURE, AND ORI IN THE DATABASE, AND REPORTS HOW MANY SUCCESSES/FAILURES.

# DATABASE DEVELOPMENT
DATABASE BUILT USING SQLITE3 POACKAGE FOR PYTHON.

# BUGS AND ASSUMPTIONS
ASSUMPTIONS MADE
1. ALL OF DAILY INCIDENT SUMMARIES ARE ASSUMED TO BE STRUCTURED THE SAME.
2. THE USER WILL ENTER A CORRECT URL.
3. THE PROGRAM WILL EXECUTE IN UNDER 60 SECONDS, IF NOT THE DB CONNECTION WILL TIMEOUT.

POTENTIAL BUGS
1. PROGRAM WILL CRASH IF A INCORRECT URL IS ENTERED.
2. MY REGULAR EXPRESSIONS MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERY SINGLE INCIDENT AND ADDRESS. I DID MY BEST TO OPTIMIZE THE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS FOR ANY INPUT; HOWEVER IF MY REGULAR EXPRESSION DOES NOT FIND THE DATA, NULL IS ASSUMED.
